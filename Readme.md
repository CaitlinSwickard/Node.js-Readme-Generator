# Node Readme Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


  ## Description
  This project generates a readme file template through prompts. Once the user has answered all the prompts it will generate a readme.md file. That readme.md file will be filled in with the users responses to the prompts. Once the file is generated they can then use the completed readme file for their own repo on any project of their choice. Each project they complete they can fill in a new readme template.
